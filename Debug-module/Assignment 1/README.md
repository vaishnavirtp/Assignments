## Bugs 

<ul>
<li>First bug - The brackets weren't closed properly.

Fix - Closed the brackets

<li>
Tried using breakpoints and visual debugger.
<br>
The most effective one was the visual debugger as we can the see the errors such as name error,indentation error directly without writing any code. But for deep internal errors we need to use the inbuilt debugger for detail information

<li>
Debbuging is an essential process for writing an error free and effective code for acheiving best possible results.
We can use visual debuggers or breakpoints for tracing through the code line by line.
